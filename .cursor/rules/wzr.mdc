# Rules!

- All labels and texts in UI must be exclusively in polish
- you can use mcp [mcp.json](mdc:c:/Users/tomas/.cursor/mcp.json) for stripe interactions, but don't expect them to work in the project we're building
- Our server files are in the /server folder
- When running terminal commands make sure you're in the right folder and use commands that work with windows 10


# Project structure
- Our server files are in the /server folder
- root folder has our frontend files
- use colors from [index.scss](mdc:src/index.scss)
