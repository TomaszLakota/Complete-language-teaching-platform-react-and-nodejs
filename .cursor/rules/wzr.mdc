# Rules!

- All labels, urls and texts in UI must be exclusively in polish!!! 
- DONT ASK ME TO DO SHIT YOU CAN DO YOURSELF! (especially looking up files or code, you do it!)
- avoid excesive changes
- make minimal changes
- DO NOT ADD COMMENTS (unless i NEED to modify something there)
- remove all dumbass comments in files you edit
- you can use mcp for stripe interactions, but don't expect them to work in the project we're building
- you can use sequencial thinking mcp for planning tasks that will take multiple steps to complete
- Our server files are in the /server folder
- When running terminal commands make sure you're in the right folder and use commands that work with windows 10!!! (&& wont work)
- When you're done with the task, update the docs to reflect changes you've made!
- make sure you update all the files you're told to edit, in any order
- make sure to follow all necessary steps



# Project structure
- Our server files are in the /server folder
- root folder has our frontend files

## Frontend
- use scss
- use colors from index.scss
- docs: [frontend_documentation.md](mdc:.cursor/frontend_documentation.md) keep the file updated!


## Backend
- available Endpoints are listed in [backend_documentation.md](mdc:.cursor/backend_documentation.md) make sure to keep the file updated 
- no need to restart server after making changes
- db schema in [db_schema.json](mdc:.cursor/rules/db_schema.json)
## Important notes

Don't `cd server && some command`, it won't work, it's windows 10. RUN 2 COMMANDS INSTEAD
- db schema in .cursor/rules/db_schema.json
- any SQL queries you to run, add them in a new file and i will run it. assume db shape is exactly as in the schema
