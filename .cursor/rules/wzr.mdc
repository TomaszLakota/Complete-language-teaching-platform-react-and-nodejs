# Rules!

- All labels, urls and texts in UI must be exclusively in polish!!! 
- DONT ASK ME TO DO SHIT YOU CAN DO YOURSELF! (especially looking up files or code, you do it!)
- avoid excesive changes
- make minimal changes
- DO NOT ADD COMMENTS UNLESS ITS NECESSARY
- remove all dumbass comments in files you edit
- you can use mcp for stripe interactions, but don't expect them to work in the project we're building
- you can use sequencial thinking mcp for planning tasks that will take multiple steps to complete
- Our server files are in the /server folder
- When running terminal commands make sure you're in the right folder and use commands that work with windows 10!!! (&& wont work)
- When you're done with the task, update the docs to reflect changes you've made!
- make sure you update all the files you're told to edit, in any order
- make sure to follow all necessary steps
