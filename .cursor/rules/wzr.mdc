# Rules!

- All labels and texts in UI must be exclusively in polish!!!
- avoid excesive changes
- make minimal changes
- you can use mcp for stripe interactions, but don't expect them to work in the project we're building
- Our server files are in the /server folder
- When running terminal commands make sure you're in the right folder and use commands that work with windows 10 (&& wont work)
- use scss


# Project structure
- Our server files are in the /server folder
- root folder has our frontend files

## Frontend
- use colors from index.scss


## Backend
- available Endpoints are listed in [backend_documentation.md](mdc:.cursor/backend_documentation.md) make sure to keep the file updated 
- no need to restart server after making changes
